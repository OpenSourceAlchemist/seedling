==Seedling
----------

Seedling is a tool for creating ruby projects.  It aims to add
tasks (via a Rakefile and some tasks/*.rake) which allow for quick
and easy publishing of your new ruby library, via github and or rubyforge.
It automates some of the monotony such as
 
* Re-Versioning
* AUTHORS updating
* .gemspec updates
* building a gem, tarball, zip, source export tree
* Test (spec) running, via a bacon task and bacon spec helper (we love bacon)
* Documentation via yard
* CHANGELOG updating

== Download

using git
 git clone git://rubyists.com/gits/seedling

==Usage
-------

To start, one can run:
 seedling --help

to see available options.

For the impatient, try this:
 seedling plant /path/to/tree
